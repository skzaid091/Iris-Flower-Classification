# Iris Flower Classification ‚ú®

**Welcome to the beautiful world of Iris flower identification! **  This project empowers you to harness the power of machine learning to accurately classify Iris flowers based on their physical characteristics.

Here's a quick guide to get you started:

**1. Installation **

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
streamlit
sklearn
plotly.express
**2. Running the App **

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command:
Bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
**3. Using the App **

Once the app launches in your web browser, you'll see a sidebar with two options: Prediction and Visualization.
**Prediction Mode **

Enter Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width in the provided fields.
Click the "Predict" button to reveal the predicted Iris species! ü™Ñ
**Visualization Mode **

Explore interactive visualizations that uncover relationships between different flower features.
Sepal Length vs Sepal Width scatter plot visualizes how these features vary across species.
Petal Length vs Petal Width scatter plot provides another perspective on species separation.
